# Azure Synapse Analytics: A Step-by-Step Guide


In this article, we will explore Azure synapse Analytics and examine how it addresses various business challenges. We will dive into the core capabilities of azure synapse analytics, helping you identify scenarios where it can be effectively used. Whether you are a data professional, business analyst or IT decision maker, this article aims to provide valuable insights into the power and potential of azure Synapse analytics. Let's dive in and discover how this robust analytics service can transform your data driven initiatives.

### What is Azure Synapse Analytics.
    
Before diving deep into [Azure Synapse analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/synapse-analytics#:~:text=Azure%20Synapse%20Analytics%20is%20an,log%20and%20time%20series%20analytics), let's first explore the different types of iof analytical techniques. This foundational knowledge will provide us with a deeper understanding of how azure Synapse analytics operates.

## Types of Analytical Techniques

There are four common types of analytical techniques: Descriptive Analytics, Diagnostic Analytics, Predictive Analytics and Prospective Analytics. Let's dive into each one to explore their unique characteristics and applications.

### Descriptive Analytics: 
    
It answers the question of `what is happening?` It involves exploring data to gain insights and provides an overview of key performance indicators. This type of analytical allows us to examine data and understand its current state and trends.

### Diagnostic analysis:
    
It answers `why it is happening?` It goes beyond descriptive analytics to dive deeper into the data, uncovering the reasons behind insights and their impact on KPIs.

### Predictive analysis:

It answers the questions `what will happen?` it uses predictive models and data from previous analytical techniques to forecast future outcomes. By analyzing historical data patterns and trends, predictive analytics provides insights into potential refuter events or behaviors.

### Prescriptive analysis: 

it answers `what should i do?` it uses advanced techniques tro forecast future outcomes and offers valuable insights for making informed decisions.

Azure Synapse analytics offers a cloud-based platform that supports a variety of analytical workloads. It integrates multiple data storage processing and analysis technologies into a single cohesive solution. This enables organization to leverage their existing investments and experience in various data technologies, such as SQL and appcache Spark. With Azure Synapse Analytics, Users can manager and analyze data through a unified interface, simplifying the process of working with different data technologies ina centralized environment.

# How Azure Synapse Analytics Works

To meet the data analytics needs of modern organization, Azure Synapse Analytics provides a centralized service that manges both data storage and processing. Its adaptable architecture allows seamless integration of various data stores, processing platform and visualization tools through linkesd services.

## 1. Creating and using an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace

Synapse Analytics workspace serves as a container for managing the services and data resources needed for our analytics solution. You can create a workspace interactively via the azure portal ort automate the deployment using azure PowerShell, azure CLI or Azure resource manager templates.
Once our synapse analytics workspace is set up, we can use a synapse studio a web base portal to manager the services within it and perform data analytic tasks, Synapse offers as a user-friendly interface for working with Azure Synapse analytics.

## 2. Working with files in a data lake

In a synapse analytics workspace, one key resource is the data lake that allows you to store and process data files at scale. By default, the workspace comes with a data lake like to an Azure data lake storage Gen2 container. You can also add linked services for additional data lakes on different storage platforms as needed.


## 3. Ingesting and transforming data with pipelines

Azure Synapse analytics streamlines the data analysis process in enterprise solutions by offering built in support for creating, managing and running pipelines. These pipelines handle tasks such as collecting data from various sources, transforming it and storing the produced data for analysis. The pipelines in Azure synapse analytics use the same technology as Azure data factory. If we are familiar with Azure data factory, you can leverage your existing skills to create data ingestion and transformation solutions with in the Azure Synapse Analytic.

## 4. Querying and manipulating data with SQL

Azure Synapse Analytics supports SQL, a widely used language for querying and manipulating Data it offers two types of SQL pools:

### 1.Built in serverless pool

The Build in serverless pool in azure synapse analytics is optimized for querying and analyzing file-based data stored in data lake using SQL. It allows you to directly query data files without the need for pre-defined structure or dedicated compute resources. This pool offers a serverless and on demand approach, where you only pay for data processed during each query. It is suitable for ad-hoc analysis and processing of data in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

### 2.Custom dedicated SQl pools: 

Custom dedicated SQL pools are designed for histing relational data warehouses. Unlike the serverless pool, these pools require dedicated compute resources provisioned specifically for your workload. They provide more control for advance analytics, complex reporting and enterprise level data modeling. The cost for custom dedicated SQL pools is based on the provisioned resources and usage time. 

Azure Synapse SQL; uses a smart way to process SQL queries called distributed query processing. It breaks down the work into smaller parts and runs them simultaneously, making it faster and scalable for analyzing relational data. The build-in serverless pool is excellent for cost-effective analysis of data stored in data lake, allowing you to analyze data on demand without managing dedicated resources. Dedicated SQL pools are ideal for creating relational data warehouses, particularly for scenarios involving complex data modeling and reporting an enterprise setting.

## 5. Processing and analyzing data with Apache Spark

Apache spark is an open source platform designed for analyzing large datasets. It processes data distributed across multiple files in a data lake by executing jobs written in various programming languages like python, scala, java SQL and C#.
In Azure Synapse analytics you can create spark pools, which enables you to use interactive notebooks, these notebooks allow you to seamlessly integrate code and notes, making them particularly useful for developing solutions related to data analytics, machine learning and data visualization.

## 6. Exploring data with Data Explorer

Azure Synapse Data Explorer, a component aof azure Synapse Analytics, is a data processing engine that uses the Azure data explorer service. It employs a user-friendly query language known as Kusto Query Language to facilitate fast and real time analysis of both bath and streaming data with minimal delay
